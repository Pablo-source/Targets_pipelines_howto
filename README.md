# Targets: how to build pipelines in R

This is a new project to practise and learn how to use Targets package to automate pipelines in R. I will start testing it with univariate time series models.

It allows to practise several skills: 

- Fuunctions building 
- Model creation
- Pipeline management
- Model fitting and upgrading 

In a further stage I will combine the output of this pipeline example with a Shiny dashboard
