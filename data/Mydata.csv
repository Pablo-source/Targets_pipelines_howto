"2","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","Yes, Uncle Vernon."
"3","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","He's asleep!"
"4","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","Sorry about him."
"5","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","He doesn't understand what it's like, lying there day after day..."
"6","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","...watching people press their ugly faces in on you."
"7","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","Can you hear me?"
"8","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","It's just, I've never talked to a snake before."
"9","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","Do you...?"
"10","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","I mean, do you talk to people often?"
"11","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","You're from Burma, aren't you?"
"12","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","Was it nice there?"
"13","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","Do you miss your family?"
"14","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","I see. That's me as well."
"15","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","I never knew my parents either."
"16","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","Mummy, Dad, come here!"
"17","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","Anytime."
"18","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","I swear, I don't know!"
"19","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","One minute the glass was there and then it was gone, it was like magic."
"20","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","Will I have to wear that too?"
"21","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","That's Dudley's old uniform."
"22","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","It'll fit me like bits of old elephant skin."
"23","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","Hey, give it back! It's mine!"
"24","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","Because there's no post on Sundays?"
"25","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","Get off!"
"26","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","They're my letters!"
"27","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","Let go of me!"
"28","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","Make a wish, Harry."
"29","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","I am."
"30","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","Thank you."
"31","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","Excuse me, who are you?"
"32","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","Sorry, no."
"33","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","Learnt what?"
"34","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","I'm a what?"
"35","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","No, you've made a mistake."
"36","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","I mean...l can't be a wizard."
"37","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","I mean, I'm just Harry."
"38","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","Just Harry."
"39","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","Dear Mr. Potter,"
"40","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","We are pleased to inform you that you have been accepted at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry."""""
"41","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","You knew?"
"42","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","You knew all along and you never told me?"
"43","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","Blown up?"
"44","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","You told me my parents died in a car crash."
"45","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","Muggle?"
"46","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","Okay."
"47","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","First year's students will require three sets of plain work robes one wand."
"48","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","One pair of dragon hide gloves."
"49","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","Hagrid, Do they mean from a real dragon?"
"50","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","You'd like a dragon?"
"51","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","All students must be equipped with one standard size 2 pewter cauldron and may bring, if they desire, either an owl, a cat or a toad."
"52","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","Can we find all this in London?"
"53","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","Oh, nice to meet you."
"54","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","Goodbye."
"55","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","But why am I famous, Hagrid?"
"56","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","All those people back there, how is it they know who I am?"
"57","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","But, Hagrid, how am I to pay for all this?"
"58","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","I haven't any money."
"59","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","Hagrid, what exactly are these things?"
"60","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","What's in there, Hagrid?"
"61","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","I still need... a wand."
"62","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","Hello?"
"63","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","Hello?"
"64","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","Sorry, but what's curious?"
"65","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","And who owned that wand?"
"66","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","He killed my parents, didn't he?"
"67","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","The one who gave me this."
"68","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","You know, Hagrid."
"69","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","I know you do."
"70","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","Maybe if you wrote it down?"
"71","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","Voldemort?"
"72","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","Me? Voldemort tried to kill me?"
"73","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","What happened to V...?"
"74","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","To You-Know-Who?"
"75","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","Platform 9 3/4?"
"76","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","But, Hagrid, there must be a mistake."
"77","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","This says platform 9 3/4."
"78","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","There's no such thing, is there?"
"79","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","Excuse me. Excuse me."
"80","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","Excuse me Sir, Can you tell me where I might find platform 9 3/4?"
"81","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","Muggles?"
"82","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","Excuse me."
"83","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","Could you tell me how to...?"
"84","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","No. Not at all."
"85","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","I'm Harry. Harry Potter."
"86","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","The what?"
"87","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","We'll take the lot."
"88","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","Bertie Bott's Every Flavor Beans?"
"89","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","These aren't real frogs, are they?"
"90","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","I've got Dumbledore!"
"91","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","Hey, he's gone!"
"92","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","Just a little bit."
"93","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","Yeah."
"94","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","Hey, Hagrid."
"95","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","I think I can tell the wrong sort for myself, thanks."
"96","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","Nothing. Nothing, I'm fine."
"97","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","Not Slytherin, not Slytherin!"
"98","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","Say, Percy, who's that teacher talking to Professor Quirrell?"
"99","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","What's he teach?"
"100","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","I think she fancies you."
"101","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","We got lost."
"102","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","I don't know, Sir."
"103","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","I don't know, Sir."
"104","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","Clearly, Hermione knows."
"105","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","Seems a pity not to ask her."
"106","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","What's Seamus trying to do to that glass of water?"
"107","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","Can I borrow this? Thanks."
"108","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","Hey Ron! Somebody broke into Gringotts."
"109","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","Listen."
"110","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","Believed to be the work of Dark wizards or witches unknown Gringotts goblins while acknowledging the breach, insist nothing was taken."
"111","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","The vault in question, number 713, had, in fact, been emptied earlier that very same day."""""
"112","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","That's odd."
"113","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","That's the vault Hagrid and I went to."
"114","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","Give it here, Malfoy."
"115","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","Give it here or I'll knock you off your broom!"
"116","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","A century, according to McGonagall."
"117","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","But I've never even played Quidditch."
"118","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","What if I make a fool of myself?"
"119","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","I-I didn't know."
"120","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","Who doesn't?"
"121","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","What's happening?"
"122","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","Let's go this way."
"123","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","Let's go."
"124","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","Run! Quick, let's hide through that door!"
"125","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","It's locked!"
"126","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","And for good reason."
"127","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","Guarding something?"
"128","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","I think so."
"129","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","What are those?"
"130","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","What was that?"
"131","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","I like this ball."
"132","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","What do I do with it?"
"133","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","Whoa."
"134","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","I think we're going to need another feather over here, Professor."
"135","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","I think she heard you."
"136","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","Where's Hermione?"
"137","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","How could a troll get in?"
"138","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","Hermione!"
"139","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","She doesn't know!"
"140","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","It's going into the Girl's Bathroom!"
"141","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","Hermione, move!"
"142","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","Whooa! Whoa, whoa!"
"143","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","Do something!"
"144","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","Anything!"
"145","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","Hurry up!"
"146","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","I don't think so."
"147","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","Just knocked out."
"148","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","Ew. Troll bogies."
"149","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","Good of you to get us out of trouble like that."
"150","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","Mind you, she might not have needed saving if you hadn't insulted her."
"151","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","I'm not hungry."
"152","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","That explains the blood."
"153","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","Listen, last night, I'm guessing Snape let the troll in as a diversion so he could try and get past that 3 headed dog."
"154","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","But, he got himself bitten, that's why he's limping."
"155","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","The day I was at Gringotts, Hagrid took something out of one of the vaults."
"156","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","He said it was Hogwarts' business, very secret."
"157","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","That's what the dog's guarding."
"158","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","That's what Snape wants."
"159","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","But I-I never get mail."
"160","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","It's a broomstick!"
"161","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","But who...?"
"162","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","A little."
"163","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","What happened?"
"164","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","Yes! Whoa!"
"165","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","Yes!"
"166","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","Whoa! Whooa!"
"167","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","Who knows."
"168","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","Why was he trying to get past that 3 headed dog on Halloween?"
"169","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","Yes?"
"170","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","But Hagrid, whatever Fluffy's guarding, Snape's trying to steal it!"
"171","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","Exactly."
"172","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","Nicholas Flamel?"
"173","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","Nicholas Flamel...Who's Nicholas Flamel?"
"174","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","Knight to E-5."
"175","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","Happy Christmas, Ron."
"176","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","What are you wearing?"
"177","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","I've got presents?"
"178","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","Oh!"
"179","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","Your father left this in my possession before he died."
"180","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","It is time it was returned to you."
"181","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","Use it well."
"182","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","Some kind of...cloak."
"183","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","My body's gone!"
"184","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","I'm invisible??"
"185","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","There was no name."
"186","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","It just said, """"Use it well."""""
"187","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","Famous fire eaters..."
"188","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","15th Century Fiends...Flamel..."
"189","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","Nicholas Flamel...where are you?"
"190","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","Mum? Dad?"
"191","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","Ron! You've really got to see this!"
"192","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","Ron! You've got to see this!"
"193","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","Ron, Ron, come on. Get out of bed!"
"194","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","There's something you've got to see."
"195","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","Now, come on!"
"196","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","Come on. Come. Come look, it's my parents!"
"197","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","Look in properly. Go on."
"198","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","Stand there. There."
"199","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","You see them, don't you?"
"200","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","Thats my dad"
"201","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","How can it?"
"202","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","Both my parents are dead."
"203","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","No."
"204","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","No."
"205","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","So, then it shows us what we want?"
"206","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","Whatever we want?"
"207","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","Malfoy."
"208","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","I found him!"
"209","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","Go on!"
"210","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","I knew the name sound familiar."
"211","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","I read it on the train that day."
"212","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","Shh!"
"213","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","Hagrid!"
"214","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","We think Snape's trying to steal it."
"215","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","Hagrid, we know he's after the Stone."
"216","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","We just don't know why."
"217","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","What?"
"218","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","Wait a minute."
"219","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","One of the teachers?"
"220","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","Uh, Hagrid, what exactly is that?"
"221","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","Norbert?"
"222","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","Malfoy."
"223","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","Hagrid always wanted a dragon."
"224","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","He told me so the first time I met him."
"225","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","I don't understand."
"226","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","50?!"
"227","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","Hagrid, what's that?"
"228","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","If I didn't know better, Draco, I'd say you were scared."
"229","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","What is it, Fang?"
"230","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","But what was that thing you saved me from?"
"231","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","But who would choose such a life?"
"232","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","Do you mean to say...that that thing that killed the unicorn..."
"233","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","that was drinking its blood...that was Voldemort?"
"234","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","The Sorcerer's Stone."
"235","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","But he's weak."
"236","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","He's living off the unicorns."
"237","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","Don't you see? We had it wrong."
"238","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","Snape doesn't want the stone for himself, he wants the stone for Voldemort."
"239","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","With the Elixir of Life, Voldemort will be strong again."
"240","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","He'll He'll come back."
"241","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","I think if he'd had the chance, he might have tried to kill me tonight."
"242","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","My scar. It keeps burning."
"243","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","Not like this."
"244","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","I think it's a warning."
"245","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","It means dangers coming. Uhh!"
"246","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","Oh. Of course!"
"247","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","Don't you think it's a bit odd that what Hagrid wants more than anything is a dragon, and a stranger shows up and just happens to have one?"
"248","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","I mean, how many people wander around with dragon eggs in their pockets?"
"249","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","Why didn't I see it before?"
"250","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","Hagrid, who gave you the dragon egg?"
"251","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","What did he look like?"
"252","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","The stranger, though, you and he must have talked."
"253","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","And did he seem interested in Fluffy?"
"254","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","We have to see Professor Dumbledore, immediately!"
"255","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","He's gone?! Now?"
"256","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","But this is important!"
"257","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","It's about...the Sorcerer's Stone."
"258","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","Someone's going to try and steal it."
"259","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","That was no stranger Hagrid met in the village."
"260","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","It was Snape, which means he knows how to get past Fluffy."
"261","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","We go down the trapdoor. Tonight."
"262","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","Trevor."
"263","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","Now, Neville, listen. We were"
"264","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","Let's go. Sorry."
"265","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","Snoring"
"266","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","Snape's already been here."
"267","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","He's put a spell on the harp."
"268","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","We have to move its paw."
"269","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","Come on! Okay. Push!"
"270","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","I'll go first."
"271","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","Don't follow until I give you a sign."
"272","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","If something bad happens, get yourselves out…"
"273","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","Does it seem a bit...quiet to you?"
"274","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","Jump! Go!"
"275","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","Whoa! Oh. Ahh!"
"276","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","Hermione! Where are you?!"
"277","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","Yeah, yeah, I'm fine."
"278","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","Apparently not."
"279","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","What?"
"280","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","Ron, are you okay?"
"281","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","Okay."
"282","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","Lucky Hermione pays attention in Herbology."
"283","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","I don't know."
"284","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","Sounds like wings."
"285","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","They're not birds, they're keys."
"286","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","And I'll bet one of them fits that door."
"287","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","I don't know. Strange."
"288","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","There! I see it!"
"289","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","The one with the broken wing!"
"290","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","It's too simple."
"291","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","Catch the key!"
"292","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","Where are we? A graveyard."
"293","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","There's the door."
"294","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","Wait a minute."
"295","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","No, Ron! No!"
"296","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","He's going to sacrifice himself!"
"297","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","RON!"
"298","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","NO! Don't move! Dont forget, we're still playing."
"299","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","Checkmate."
"300","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","Take care of Ron. Then, go to the owlery."
"301","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","Send a message to Dumbledore."
"302","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","Ron's right...I have to go on."
"303","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","Not as good as you."
"304","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","You? No. It can't be...Snape. He was the one"
"305","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","B-but, that day, during the Quidditch Match, Snape tried to kill me."
"306","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","Snape was trying to...save me?"
"307","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","Th-then you let the troll in."
"308","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","I-I'm shaking hands with Dumbledore."
"309","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","I've won the house cup."
"310","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","Voldemort."
"311","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","Never!"
"312","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","You liar!"
"313","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","Ahhhhhhhhh!"
"314","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","Admirers?"
"315","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","Ron was here?"
"316","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","Is he all right?"
"317","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","What about Hermione?"
"318","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","But, what happened to the Stone?"
"319","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","But Flamel, he'll die, won't he?"
"320","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","How is it I got the Stone, sir?"
"321","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","One minute I was staring in the mirror, and the next..."
"322","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","Does that mean, with the Stone gone, I mean, that Voldemort can never come back?"
"323","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","What is it?"
"324","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","All right there, Ron?"
"325","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","All right. Hermione?"
"326","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","Good job."
"327","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","One minute."
"328","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","Thanks, Hagrid."
"329","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","But Hagrid, we're not allowed to do magic away from Hogwarts. You know that."
"330","Harry James Potter","Gryffindor","I'm not going home. Not really."
"331","Ronald Bilius Weasley","Gryffindor","Excuse me. Do you mind?"
"332","Ronald Bilius Weasley","Gryffindor","Everywhere else is full."
"333","Ronald Bilius Weasley","Gryffindor","I'm Ron, by the way."
"334","Ronald Bilius Weasley","Gryffindor","Ron Weasley."
"335","Ronald Bilius Weasley","Gryffindor","So it's true!"
"336","Ronald Bilius Weasley","Gryffindor","I mean, do you really have the...?"
"337","Ronald Bilius Weasley","Gryffindor","The scar?"
"338","Ronald Bilius Weasley","Gryffindor","Wicked!"
"339","Ronald Bilius Weasley","Gryffindor","No, thanks. I'm all set."
"340","Ronald Bilius Weasley","Gryffindor","They mean every flavor."
"341","Ronald Bilius Weasley","Gryffindor","There's chocolate and peppermint and there's also spinach, liver and tripe."
"342","Ronald Bilius Weasley","Gryffindor","George sweared he got a bogey-flavoured one once!"
"343","Ronald Bilius Weasley","Gryffindor","It's just a spell."
"344","Ronald Bilius Weasley","Gryffindor","Besides, It's the cards you want."
"345","Ronald Bilius Weasley","Gryffindor","Each pack's got a famous witch or wizard."
"346","Ronald Bilius Weasley","Gryffindor","I've got about 500 myself."
"347","Ronald Bilius Weasley","Gryffindor","Watch it!"
"348","Ronald Bilius Weasley","Gryffindor","Oh, that's rotten luck."
"349","Ronald Bilius Weasley","Gryffindor","They've only got one good jump in them to begin with."
"350","Ronald Bilius Weasley","Gryffindor","I got about six of him."
"351","Ronald Bilius Weasley","Gryffindor","Well, you can't expect him to hang around all day, can you?"
"352","Ronald Bilius Weasley","Gryffindor","This is Scabbers, by the way."
"353","Ronald Bilius Weasley","Gryffindor","Pathetic, isn't he?"
"354","Ronald Bilius Weasley","Gryffindor","Fred gave me a spell as to turn him yellow."
"355","Ronald Bilius Weasley","Gryffindor","Want to see?"
"356","Ronald Bilius Weasley","Gryffindor","No."
"357","Ronald Bilius Weasley","Gryffindor","Sunshine, daisies, butter mellow."
"358","Ronald Bilius Weasley","Gryffindor","Turn this stupid fat rat yellow."
"359","Ronald Bilius Weasley","Gryffindor","I'm Ron Weasley."
"360","Ronald Bilius Weasley","Gryffindor","Wicked."
"361","Ronald Bilius Weasley","Gryffindor","Mental, that one, I'm telling you."
"362","Ronald Bilius Weasley","Gryffindor","There isn't a witch or wizard who went bad who wasn't in Slytherin."
"363","Ronald Bilius Weasley","Gryffindor","Harry, what is it?"
"364","Ronald Bilius Weasley","Gryffindor","I know you."
"365","Ronald Bilius Weasley","Gryffindor","You're Nearly Headless Nick."
"366","Ronald Bilius Weasley","Gryffindor","Look at that one."
"367","Ronald Bilius Weasley","Gryffindor","Made it!"
"368","Ronald Bilius Weasley","Gryffindor","Can you imagine the look on old McGonagall's face if we were late?"
"369","Ronald Bilius Weasley","Gryffindor","That was bloody brilliant!"
"370","Ronald Bilius Weasley","Gryffindor","Turn it into rum."
"371","Ronald Bilius Weasley","Gryffindor","Actually managed a weak tea yesterday, before..."
"372","Ronald Bilius Weasley","Gryffindor","Mail's here."
"373","Ronald Bilius Weasley","Gryffindor","Up. Up!"
"374","Ronald Bilius Weasley","Gryffindor","Shut up, Harry."
"375","Ronald Bilius Weasley","Gryffindor","Seeker?"
"376","Ronald Bilius Weasley","Gryffindor","But first years never make their house teams!"
"377","Ronald Bilius Weasley","Gryffindor","You must be the youngest Quidditch player in"
"378","Ronald Bilius Weasley","Gryffindor","Fred and George are on the team, too."
"379","Ronald Bilius Weasley","Gryffindor","Beaters."
"380","Ronald Bilius Weasley","Gryffindor","Oh, go on, Harry,"
"381","Ronald Bilius Weasley","Gryffindor","Quidditch is great."
"382","Ronald Bilius Weasley","Gryffindor","Best game there is!"
"383","Ronald Bilius Weasley","Gryffindor","And you'll be great, too!"
"384","Ronald Bilius Weasley","Gryffindor","Whoa."
"385","Ronald Bilius Weasley","Gryffindor","Harry, you never told me your father was a Seeker, too."
"386","Ronald Bilius Weasley","Gryffindor","I'm telling you, it's spooky."
"387","Ronald Bilius Weasley","Gryffindor","She knows more about you than you do."
"388","Ronald Bilius Weasley","Gryffindor","Ahh!"
"389","Ronald Bilius Weasley","Gryffindor","Before the staircase moves again."
"390","Ronald Bilius Weasley","Gryffindor","Does anybody feel like...we shouldn't be here?"
"391","Ronald Bilius Weasley","Gryffindor","It's Filch's cat!"
"392","Ronald Bilius Weasley","Gryffindor","That's it, we're done for!"
"393","Ronald Bilius Weasley","Gryffindor","Alohomora?"
"394","Ronald Bilius Weasley","Gryffindor","Probably thinks this door's locked."
"395","Ronald Bilius Weasley","Gryffindor","What do they think they're doing??"
"396","Ronald Bilius Weasley","Gryffindor","Keeping a thing like that locked up in a school."
"397","Ronald Bilius Weasley","Gryffindor","I wasn't looking at its feet!"
"398","Ronald Bilius Weasley","Gryffindor","I was a bit preoccupied with its heads."
"399","Ronald Bilius Weasley","Gryffindor","Or maybe you didn't notice, there were three!"
"400","Ronald Bilius Weasley","Gryffindor","She needs to sort out her priorities!"
"401","Ronald Bilius Weasley","Gryffindor","Wingardrium Leviosar."
"402","Ronald Bilius Weasley","Gryffindor","You do it then if you're so clever."
"403","Ronald Bilius Weasley","Gryffindor","Go on, go on."
"404","Ronald Bilius Weasley","Gryffindor","It's Leviosa, not Leviosar."
"405","Ronald Bilius Weasley","Gryffindor","Honestly, she's a nightmare."
"406","Ronald Bilius Weasley","Gryffindor","No wonder she hasn't got any friends!"
"407","Ronald Bilius Weasley","Gryffindor","Not by itself."
"408","Ronald Bilius Weasley","Gryffindor","Trolls are really stupid."
"409","Ronald Bilius Weasley","Gryffindor","Probably people playing jokes."
"410","Ronald Bilius Weasley","Gryffindor","What?"
"411","Ronald Bilius Weasley","Gryffindor","I think the troll's left the dungeon."
"412","Ronald Bilius Weasley","Gryffindor","Hey, pea brain!"
"413","Ronald Bilius Weasley","Gryffindor","What?"
"414","Ronald Bilius Weasley","Gryffindor","Wingardium Leviosa!"
"415","Ronald Bilius Weasley","Gryffindor","Cool!"
"416","Ronald Bilius Weasley","Gryffindor","Mind you, we did save her life."
"417","Ronald Bilius Weasley","Gryffindor","What are friends for?"
"418","Ronald Bilius Weasley","Gryffindor","Take a bit of toast, mate. Go on."
"419","Ronald Bilius Weasley","Gryffindor","Let's open it."
"420","Ronald Bilius Weasley","Gryffindor","Thats not just a broomstick, Harry."
"421","Ronald Bilius Weasley","Gryffindor","It's a Nimbus 2000!"
"422","Ronald Bilius Weasley","Gryffindor","Jinxing the broom?"
"423","Ronald Bilius Weasley","Gryffindor","What do we do?"
"424","Ronald Bilius Weasley","Gryffindor","Come on, Hermione!"
"425","Ronald Bilius Weasley","Gryffindor","Go!"
"426","Ronald Bilius Weasley","Gryffindor","Fluffy?"
"427","Ronald Bilius Weasley","Gryffindor","Queen to E-5."
"428","Ronald Bilius Weasley","Gryffindor","That's wizard's chess."
"429","Ronald Bilius Weasley","Gryffindor","I see you've packed."
"430","Ronald Bilius Weasley","Gryffindor","Change of plans."
"431","Ronald Bilius Weasley","Gryffindor","My parents decided to go to Romania to visit my brother, Charlie."
"432","Ronald Bilius Weasley","Gryffindor","He's studying dragons there!"
"433","Ronald Bilius Weasley","Gryffindor","We've looked a hundred times!"
"434","Ronald Bilius Weasley","Gryffindor","I think we've had a bad influence on her."
"435","Ronald Bilius Weasley","Gryffindor","Harry, wake up!"
"436","Ronald Bilius Weasley","Gryffindor","Come on Harry, wake up!"
"437","Ronald Bilius Weasley","Gryffindor","Happy Christmas, Harry."
"438","Ronald Bilius Weasley","Gryffindor","Oh, Mum made it."
"439","Ronald Bilius Weasley","Gryffindor","Looks like you've got one too!"
"440","Ronald Bilius Weasley","Gryffindor","Yeah!"
"441","Ronald Bilius Weasley","Gryffindor","There they are."
"442","Ronald Bilius Weasley","Gryffindor","What is it?"
"443","Ronald Bilius Weasley","Gryffindor","Well, let's see then."
"444","Ronald Bilius Weasley","Gryffindor","Put it on."
"445","Ronald Bilius Weasley","Gryffindor","Whoa!"
"446","Ronald Bilius Weasley","Gryffindor","I know what that is!"
"447","Ronald Bilius Weasley","Gryffindor","That's an invisibility cloak!"
"448","Ronald Bilius Weasley","Gryffindor","They're really rare."
"449","Ronald Bilius Weasley","Gryffindor","I wonder who gave it to you."
"450","Ronald Bilius Weasley","Gryffindor","Why?"
"451","Ronald Bilius Weasley","Gryffindor","I only see us."
"452","Ronald Bilius Weasley","Gryffindor","That's me! Only, I'm head boy...and"
"453","Ronald Bilius Weasley","Gryffindor","I'm holding the Quidditch cup!"
"454","Ronald Bilius Weasley","Gryffindor","And bloody hell, I'm Quidditch Captain too!"
"455","Ronald Bilius Weasley","Gryffindor","I look good."
"456","Ronald Bilius Weasley","Gryffindor","Harry, do you think this mirror shows the future?"
"457","Ronald Bilius Weasley","Gryffindor","I'll be right back."
"458","Ronald Bilius Weasley","Gryffindor","Wanna play chess?"
"459","Ronald Bilius Weasley","Gryffindor","Wanna go and visit Hagrid?"
"460","Ronald Bilius Weasley","Gryffindor","Harry, I know what you're thinking, but don't."
"461","Ronald Bilius Weasley","Gryffindor","There's something not right about that mirror."
"462","Ronald Bilius Weasley","Gryffindor","I'm ready. Ask me any question."
"463","Ronald Bilius Weasley","Gryffindor","I forgot."
"464","Ronald Bilius Weasley","Gryffindor","Copy off you."
"465","Ronald Bilius Weasley","Gryffindor","That's insulting!"
"466","Ronald Bilius Weasley","Gryffindor","It's as if they don't trust us! Dumbledore again!"
"467","Ronald Bilius Weasley","Gryffindor","Leg-Locker Curse?"
"468","Ronald Bilius Weasley","Gryffindor","You have got to start standing up to people, Neville."
"469","Ronald Bilius Weasley","Gryffindor","Dumbledore is particularly famous for his defeat of the dark wizard Grindelwald in 1945."
"470","Ronald Bilius Weasley","Gryffindor","For the discovery of the twelve uses of dragon blood...and his work on alchemy with his partner, Nicholas Flamel!"
"471","Ronald Bilius Weasley","Gryffindor","This is light?"
"472","Ronald Bilius Weasley","Gryffindor","Immortal?"
"473","Ronald Bilius Weasley","Gryffindor","I know what it means!"
"474","Ronald Bilius Weasley","Gryffindor","I know what that is!"
"475","Ronald Bilius Weasley","Gryffindor","But Hagrid, how did you get one?"
"476","Ronald Bilius Weasley","Gryffindor","That's not just a dragon."
"477","Ronald Bilius Weasley","Gryffindor","That's a Norwegian Ridgeback!"
"478","Ronald Bilius Weasley","Gryffindor","My brother Charlie works with these in Romania."
"479","Ronald Bilius Weasley","Gryffindor","It's crazy."
"480","Ronald Bilius Weasley","Gryffindor","And worse, Malfoy knows."
"481","Ronald Bilius Weasley","Gryffindor","It's bad."
"482","Ronald Bilius Weasley","Gryffindor","Okay."
"483","Ronald Bilius Weasley","Gryffindor","But if he comes back, you don't think he'll try to kill you, do you?"
"484","Ronald Bilius Weasley","Gryffindor","And to think, I've been worrying about my Potions final!"
"485","Ronald Bilius Weasley","Gryffindor","Speak for yourself."
"486","Ronald Bilius Weasley","Gryffindor","All right there, Harry?"
"487","Ronald Bilius Weasley","Gryffindor","Perhaps you should see the nurse."
"488","Ronald Bilius Weasley","Gryffindor","Trevor shh!"
"489","Ronald Bilius Weasley","Gryffindor","Go, you shouldn't be here!"
"490","Ronald Bilius Weasley","Gryffindor","You're a little scary sometimes...you know that?"
"491","Ronald Bilius Weasley","Gryffindor","Brilliant, but scary."
"492","Ronald Bilius Weasley","Gryffindor","It's for your own good, you know."
"493","Ronald Bilius Weasley","Gryffindor","Sorry."
"494","Ronald Bilius Weasley","Gryffindor","Wait a minute...he's...."
"495","Ronald Bilius Weasley","Gryffindor","Uh. It's got horrible breath!"
"496","Ronald Bilius Weasley","Gryffindor","What?!"
"497","Ronald Bilius Weasley","Gryffindor","Ew! Yuck! Ugh."
"498","Ronald Bilius Weasley","Gryffindor","Ahh! Whoa."
"499","Ronald Bilius Weasley","Gryffindor","Lucky this plant-thing is here, really."
"500","Ronald Bilius Weasley","Gryffindor","Kill us faster?!"
"501","Ronald Bilius Weasley","Gryffindor","Oh, now I can relax!"
"502","Ronald Bilius Weasley","Gryffindor","Now what are we gonna do?!"
"503","Ronald Bilius Weasley","Gryffindor","Ahh! Harry!"
"504","Ronald Bilius Weasley","Gryffindor","Harry!"
"505","Ronald Bilius Weasley","Gryffindor","Help!"
"506","Ronald Bilius Weasley","Gryffindor","Help! Help me!"
"507","Ronald Bilius Weasley","Gryffindor","Help!"
"508","Ronald Bilius Weasley","Gryffindor","Ahhh!"
"509","Ronald Bilius Weasley","Gryffindor","Yeah."
"510","Ronald Bilius Weasley","Gryffindor","Whew. Lucky we didn't panic!"
"511","Ronald Bilius Weasley","Gryffindor","Alohomora!"
"512","Ronald Bilius Weasley","Gryffindor","Well, it was worth a try."
"513","Ronald Bilius Weasley","Gryffindor","We're looking for a big old fashioned one."
"514","Ronald Bilius Weasley","Gryffindor","Probably rusty like the handle."
"515","Ronald Bilius Weasley","Gryffindor","Oh, go on, Harry!"
"516","Ronald Bilius Weasley","Gryffindor","If Snape can catch it on that old broomstick, you can!"
"517","Ronald Bilius Weasley","Gryffindor","You're the youngest seeker in a century!"
"518","Ronald Bilius Weasley","Gryffindor","This complicates things a bit!"
"519","Ronald Bilius Weasley","Gryffindor","Hurry up!"
"520","Ronald Bilius Weasley","Gryffindor","This is no graveyard."
"521","Ronald Bilius Weasley","Gryffindor","It's a chessboard."
"522","Ronald Bilius Weasley","Gryffindor","It's obvious, isn't it?"
"523","Ronald Bilius Weasley","Gryffindor","We've got to play our way across the room."
"524","Ronald Bilius Weasley","Gryffindor","All right. Harry, you take the empty Bishop's square."
"525","Ronald Bilius Weasley","Gryffindor","Hermione, you'll be the Queen's side castle."
"526","Ronald Bilius Weasley","Gryffindor","As for me, I'll be a knight."
"527","Ronald Bilius Weasley","Gryffindor","Well, white moves first, and then...we play."
"528","Ronald Bilius Weasley","Gryffindor","You there! D-5!"
"529","Ronald Bilius Weasley","Gryffindor","Yes, Hermione, I think this is going to be exactly like wizard's chess!"
"530","Ronald Bilius Weasley","Gryffindor","Castle to E-4!"
"531","Ronald Bilius Weasley","Gryffindor","Pawn to C-3!"
"532","Ronald Bilius Weasley","Gryffindor","You understand right, Harry."
"533","Ronald Bilius Weasley","Gryffindor","Once I make my move, the Queen will take me...then you'll be free to check the King."
"534","Ronald Bilius Weasley","Gryffindor","Do you want to stop Snape from getting that Stone or not?"
"535","Ronald Bilius Weasley","Gryffindor","Harry, it's you that has to go on. I know it."
"536","Ronald Bilius Weasley","Gryffindor","Not me, not Hermione, you."
"537","Ronald Bilius Weasley","Gryffindor","Knight...to H-3."
"538","Ronald Bilius Weasley","Gryffindor","Check."
"539","Ronald Bilius Weasley","Gryffindor","Ahhhh!"
"540","Ronald Bilius Weasley","Gryffindor","All right? You?"
"541","Hermione Jean Granger","Gryffindor","Has anyone seen a toad?"
"542","Hermione Jean Granger","Gryffindor","A boy named Neville's lost one"
"543","Hermione Jean Granger","Gryffindor","Oh, are you doing magic?"
"544","Hermione Jean Granger","Gryffindor","Let's see, then."
"545","Hermione Jean Granger","Gryffindor","Are you sure that's a real spell?"
"546","Hermione Jean Granger","Gryffindor","Well, it's not very good, is it?"
"547","Hermione Jean Granger","Gryffindor","Of course, I've only tried a few simple ones myself but they've all worked for me."
"548","Hermione Jean Granger","Gryffindor","For example:"
"549","Hermione Jean Granger","Gryffindor","Oculus Reparo."
"550","Hermione Jean Granger","Gryffindor","That's better, isn't it?"
"551","Hermione Jean Granger","Gryffindor","Holy cricket, you're Harry Potter!"
"552","Hermione Jean Granger","Gryffindor","I'm Hermione Granger."
"553","Hermione Jean Granger","Gryffindor","And you are...?"
"554","Hermione Jean Granger","Gryffindor","Pleasure."
"555","Hermione Jean Granger","Gryffindor","You two better change into robes."
"556","Hermione Jean Granger","Gryffindor","I expect we'll be arriving soon."
"557","Hermione Jean Granger","Gryffindor","You've got dirt on your nose, by the way."
"558","Hermione Jean Granger","Gryffindor","Did you know?"
"559","Hermione Jean Granger","Gryffindor","Just there."
"560","Hermione Jean Granger","Gryffindor","It's not real, the ceiling."
"561","Hermione Jean Granger","Gryffindor","It's just bewitched to look like the night sky."
"562","Hermione Jean Granger","Gryffindor","I read about it in Hogwarts: A History."
"563","Hermione Jean Granger","Gryffindor","Oh, no. Okay, relax."
"564","Hermione Jean Granger","Gryffindor","Nearly headless?"
"565","Hermione Jean Granger","Gryffindor","How can you be nearly headless?"
"566","Hermione Jean Granger","Gryffindor","I've read about those."
"567","Hermione Jean Granger","Gryffindor","When the smoke turns red, it means you've forgotten something."
"568","Hermione Jean Granger","Gryffindor","Up. Up. Up!"
"569","Hermione Jean Granger","Gryffindor","Harry, no way!"
"570","Hermione Jean Granger","Gryffindor","You heard what Madam Hooch said."
"571","Hermione Jean Granger","Gryffindor","Besides, you don't even know how to fly."
"572","Hermione Jean Granger","Gryffindor","What an idiot."
"573","Hermione Jean Granger","Gryffindor","You won't make a fool of yourself."
"574","Hermione Jean Granger","Gryffindor","It's in your blood."
"575","Hermione Jean Granger","Gryffindor","The staircases change, remember?"
"576","Hermione Jean Granger","Gryffindor","We're not supposed to be here."
"577","Hermione Jean Granger","Gryffindor","This is the 3rd floor."
"578","Hermione Jean Granger","Gryffindor","It's forbidden."
"579","Hermione Jean Granger","Gryffindor","Oh, move over!"
"580","Hermione Jean Granger","Gryffindor","Alohomora"
"581","Hermione Jean Granger","Gryffindor","Get in"
"582","Hermione Jean Granger","Gryffindor","Standard book of spells, Chapter 7."
"583","Hermione Jean Granger","Gryffindor","Filch is gone."
"584","Hermione Jean Granger","Gryffindor","It was locked."
"585","Hermione Jean Granger","Gryffindor","You don't use your eyes, do you?"
"586","Hermione Jean Granger","Gryffindor","Didn't you see what it was standing on?"
"587","Hermione Jean Granger","Gryffindor","It was standing on a trap door."
"588","Hermione Jean Granger","Gryffindor","Which means it wasn't there by accident."
"589","Hermione Jean Granger","Gryffindor","It's guarding something."
"590","Hermione Jean Granger","Gryffindor","That's right."
"591","Hermione Jean Granger","Gryffindor","Now, if you two don't mind, I'm going to bed before either of you come up with another clever idea to get us killed...or worse, expelled!"
"592","Hermione Jean Granger","Gryffindor","Stop, stop, stop."
"593","Hermione Jean Granger","Gryffindor","You're going to take someone's eye out."
"594","Hermione Jean Granger","Gryffindor","Besides, youre saying it wrong."
"595","Hermione Jean Granger","Gryffindor","It's Leviosa, not Leviosar."
"596","Hermione Jean Granger","Gryffindor","Wingardium Leviosa."
"597","Hermione Jean Granger","Gryffindor","Help! Help!"
"598","Hermione Jean Granger","Gryffindor","Ahhh! Help!"
"599","Hermione Jean Granger","Gryffindor","Swish and flick!"
"600","Hermione Jean Granger","Gryffindor","Is it...dead?"
"601","Hermione Jean Granger","Gryffindor","It's my fault, Professor McGonagall."
"602","Hermione Jean Granger","Gryffindor","I went looking for the troll."
"603","Hermione Jean Granger","Gryffindor","I'd read about them and thought I could handle it."
"604","Hermione Jean Granger","Gryffindor","But I was wrong."
"605","Hermione Jean Granger","Gryffindor","If Harry and Ron hadn't come and found me..."
"606","Hermione Jean Granger","Gryffindor","I'd probably be dead."
"607","Hermione Jean Granger","Gryffindor","Ron's right, Harry."
"608","Hermione Jean Granger","Gryffindor","You're gonna need your strength today."
"609","Hermione Jean Granger","Gryffindor","Blood?"
"610","Hermione Jean Granger","Gryffindor","But why would anyone go near that dog?"
"611","Hermione Jean Granger","Gryffindor","So you're saying..."
"612","Hermione Jean Granger","Gryffindor","Bit early for mail, isn't it?"
"613","Hermione Jean Granger","Gryffindor","It's Snape!"
"614","Hermione Jean Granger","Gryffindor","He's jinxing the broom!"
"615","Hermione Jean Granger","Gryffindor","Leave it to me."
"616","Hermione Jean Granger","Gryffindor","Lacarnum Inflamarae."
"617","Hermione Jean Granger","Gryffindor","Whoo-hoo!"
"618","Hermione Jean Granger","Gryffindor","That thing has a name?"
"619","Hermione Jean Granger","Gryffindor","Hogwarts teacher or not, I know a curse when I see one."
"620","Hermione Jean Granger","Gryffindor","I've read all about them."
"621","Hermione Jean Granger","Gryffindor","You have to keep eye contact."
"622","Hermione Jean Granger","Gryffindor","And Snape wasn't blinking."
"623","Hermione Jean Granger","Gryffindor","I don't know."
"624","Hermione Jean Granger","Gryffindor","That's totally barbaric!"
"625","Hermione Jean Granger","Gryffindor","See you haven't."
"626","Hermione Jean Granger","Gryffindor","Good. You can help Harry, then."
"627","Hermione Jean Granger","Gryffindor","He's going to go the library for information on Nicholas Flamel."
"628","Hermione Jean Granger","Gryffindor","Not in the restricted section..."
"629","Hermione Jean Granger","Gryffindor","Happy Christmas."
"630","Hermione Jean Granger","Gryffindor","Look at you, playing with your cards."
"631","Hermione Jean Granger","Gryffindor","Pathetic!"
"632","Hermione Jean Granger","Gryffindor","We've got final exams coming up soon."
"633","Hermione Jean Granger","Gryffindor","Alright, what are the 3 most crucial ingredients in a Forgetfulness Potion?"
"634","Hermione Jean Granger","Gryffindor","Follow me!"
"635","Hermione Jean Granger","Gryffindor","I had you looking in the wrong section!"
"636","Hermione Jean Granger","Gryffindor","How could I be so stupid?"
"637","Hermione Jean Granger","Gryffindor","I checked this out a few weeks ago for a bit of light reading."
"638","Hermione Jean Granger","Gryffindor","Of course! Here it is!"
"639","Hermione Jean Granger","Gryffindor","Nicholas Flamel is the only known maker of the Philosopher's Stone!"
"640","Hermione Jean Granger","Gryffindor","Honestly, don't you two read?"
"641","Hermione Jean Granger","Gryffindor","The Philosopher's Stone is a legendary substance with astonishing powers."
"642","Hermione Jean Granger","Gryffindor","It will turn any metal into pure gold and produces the Elixir of Life, which will make the drinker immortal."
"643","Hermione Jean Granger","Gryffindor","It means you'll never die."
"644","Hermione Jean Granger","Gryffindor","The only stone currently in existence belongs to Mr. Nicholas Flamel, the noted alchemist, who last year celebrated his 665th birthday!"
"645","Hermione Jean Granger","Gryffindor","That's what Fluffy's guarding on the 3rd floor."
"646","Hermione Jean Granger","Gryffindor","That's what's under the trapdoor..."
"647","Hermione Jean Granger","Gryffindor","the Philosopher's Stone!"
"648","Hermione Jean Granger","Gryffindor","Of course! There are other things defending the Stone, aren't there?"
"649","Hermione Jean Granger","Gryffindor","Spells and enchantments."
"650","Hermione Jean Granger","Gryffindor","Is that...a dragon?"
"651","Hermione Jean Granger","Gryffindor","Is that bad?"
"652","Hermione Jean Granger","Gryffindor","Well, that's good, isn't it?"
"653","Hermione Jean Granger","Gryffindor","He'll be with his own kind."
"654","Hermione Jean Granger","Gryffindor","Harry!"
"655","Hermione Jean Granger","Gryffindor","You mean, You-Know-Who's out there, right now, in the forest?"
"656","Hermione Jean Granger","Gryffindor","Hang on a minute."
"657","Hermione Jean Granger","Gryffindor","We're forgetting one thing."
"658","Hermione Jean Granger","Gryffindor","Who's the one wizard Voldemort always feared?"
"659","Hermione Jean Granger","Gryffindor","Dumbledore!"
"660","Hermione Jean Granger","Gryffindor","As long as Dumbledore's around, you're safe."
"661","Hermione Jean Granger","Gryffindor","As long as Dumbledore's around, you can't be touched."
"662","Hermione Jean Granger","Gryffindor","I've always heard Hogwarts' end of the year exams were frightful, but I found that rather enjoyable."
"663","Hermione Jean Granger","Gryffindor","It's happened before."
"664","Hermione Jean Granger","Gryffindor","What is it?"
"665","Hermione Jean Granger","Gryffindor","And with Dumbledore gone"
"666","Hermione Jean Granger","Gryffindor","Uh...we were just..."
"667","Hermione Jean Granger","Gryffindor","Now what do we do?"
"668","Hermione Jean Granger","Gryffindor","Neville, I'm really, really sorry about this"
"669","Hermione Jean Granger","Gryffindor","Petrificus Totalus."
"670","Hermione Jean Granger","Gryffindor","Sorry."
"671","Hermione Jean Granger","Gryffindor","Ow! You stood on my foot!"
"672","Hermione Jean Granger","Gryffindor","Alohomora."
"673","Hermione Jean Granger","Gryffindor","The harp. It stopped playing."
"674","Hermione Jean Granger","Gryffindor","Stop moving, both of you."
"675","Hermione Jean Granger","Gryffindor","This is Devil's Snare."
"676","Hermione Jean Granger","Gryffindor","You have to relax."
"677","Hermione Jean Granger","Gryffindor","If you don't, it will only kill you faster."
"678","Hermione Jean Granger","Gryffindor","Just relax!"
"679","Hermione Jean Granger","Gryffindor","Do what I say. Trust me."
"680","Hermione Jean Granger","Gryffindor","Are you okay?"
"681","Hermione Jean Granger","Gryffindor","He's not relaxing, is he?"
"682","Hermione Jean Granger","Gryffindor","We've got to do something!"
"683","Hermione Jean Granger","Gryffindor","Uh! I remember reading something in Herbology."
"684","Hermione Jean Granger","Gryffindor","Um Devil's Snare, Devil's Scare,it's deadly fun...but will sulk in the sun!"
"685","Hermione Jean Granger","Gryffindor","That's it! Devil's Snare hates sunlight!"
"686","Hermione Jean Granger","Gryffindor","Lumus Solem!"
"687","Hermione Jean Granger","Gryffindor","What is that?"
"688","Hermione Jean Granger","Gryffindor","Curious. I've never seen birds like these."
"689","Hermione Jean Granger","Gryffindor","What's this all about?"
"690","Hermione Jean Granger","Gryffindor","Ugh! What're we going to do?"
"691","Hermione Jean Granger","Gryffindor","There must be 1000 keys up there!"
"692","Hermione Jean Granger","Gryffindor","What's wrong, Harry?"
"693","Hermione Jean Granger","Gryffindor","I don't like this."
"694","Hermione Jean Granger","Gryffindor","I don't like this at all."
"695","Hermione Jean Granger","Gryffindor","Now what do we do?"
"696","Hermione Jean Granger","Gryffindor","What happens now?"
"697","Hermione Jean Granger","Gryffindor","Ron, you don't suppose this is going to be like...real wizard's chess, do you?"
"698","Hermione Jean Granger","Gryffindor","What is it?"
"699","Hermione Jean Granger","Gryffindor","No, Ron, you can't!"
"700","Hermione Jean Granger","Gryffindor","There must be another way!"
"701","Hermione Jean Granger","Gryffindor","You'll be okay, Harry."
"702","Hermione Jean Granger","Gryffindor","You're a great wizard, you really are."
"703","Hermione Jean Granger","Gryffindor","Me? Books and cleverness?"
"704","Hermione Jean Granger","Gryffindor","There are more important things."
"705","Hermione Jean Granger","Gryffindor","Friendship, and bravery."
"706","Hermione Jean Granger","Gryffindor","And Harry, just be careful."
"707","Hermione Jean Granger","Gryffindor","Never better."
"708","Hermione Jean Granger","Gryffindor","We're tied with Slytherin!"
"709","Hermione Jean Granger","Gryffindor","Come on, Harry."
"710","Hermione Jean Granger","Gryffindor","Feels strange to be going home, doesn't it?"
"711","Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore","Gryffindor","I should've known that you would be here, Professor McGonagall."
"712","Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore","Gryffindor","I'm afraid so, professor."
"713","Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore","Gryffindor","The good and the bad."
"714","Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore","Gryffindor","Hagrid is bringing him."
"715","Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore","Gryffindor","Ah, Professor, I would trust Hagrid with my life."
"716","Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore","Gryffindor","No problems, I trust, Hagrid?"
"717","Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore","Gryffindor","Albus, do you really think it's safe, leaving him with these people?"
"718","Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore","Gryffindor","The only family he has."
"719","Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore","Gryffindor","Exactly."
"720","Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore","Gryffindor","He's far better off growing up away from all of that."
"721","Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore","Gryffindor","Until he's ready."
"722","Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore","Gryffindor","There, there, Hagrid."
"723","Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore","Gryffindor","It's not really goodbye, after all."
"724","Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore","Gryffindor","Good luck...Harry Potter."
"725","Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore","Gryffindor","I have a few start-of-term notices I wish to announce."
"726","Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore","Gryffindor","The first years, please note that the Dark Forest is strictly forbidden to all students."
"727","Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore","Gryffindor","Also, our caretaker, Mr. Filch, has asked me to remind you that the third-floor corridor on the right hand side is out of bounds to everyone who does not wish to die a most painful death."
"728","Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore","Gryffindor","Thank you."
"729","Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore","Gryffindor","Let the feast begin."
"730","Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore","Gryffindor","SILLLLLEEENNNNCEEEEE!"
"731","Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore","Gryffindor","Everyone will please, not panic."
"732","Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore","Gryffindor","Now, Prefects will lead their houses back to the dormitories."
"733","Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore","Gryffindor","Teachers will follow me to the dungeons."
"734","Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore","Gryffindor","Back again, Harry?"
"735","Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore","Gryffindor","I see that you, like so many before you, have discovered the delights of the Mirror of Erised."
"736","Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore","Gryffindor","I trust by now you realize what it does."
"737","Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore","Gryffindor","Let me give you a clue."
"738","Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore","Gryffindor","The happiest man on earth would look into the mirror and see only himself, exactly as he is."
"739","Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore","Gryffindor","Yes...and no."
"740","Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore","Gryffindor","It shows us nothing more or less than the deepest, most desperate desires of our hearts."
"741","Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore","Gryffindor","Now you, who have never known your family, you see them standing beside you."
"742","Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore","Gryffindor","But remember this, Harry."
"743","Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore","Gryffindor","This mirror gives us neither knowledge or truth."
"744","Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore","Gryffindor","Men have wasted away in front of it, even gone mad."
"745","Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore","Gryffindor","That is why tomorrow it will be moved to a new home, and I must ask you not to go looking for it again."
"746","Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore","Gryffindor","It does not do to dwell on dreams, Harry, and forget to live."
"747","Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore","Gryffindor","Good afternoon, Harry."
"748","Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore","Gryffindor","Ah. Tokens from your admirers?"
"749","Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore","Gryffindor","What happened down in the dungeons between you and Professor Quirrell is a complete secret, so, naturally, the whole school knows."
"750","Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore","Gryffindor","Ah, I see your friend Ronald has saved you the trouble of opening your Chocolate Frogs."
"751","Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore","Gryffindor","Fine. They're both just fine."
"752","Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore","Gryffindor","Relax, dear boy. The stone has been destroyed."
"753","Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore","Gryffindor","My friend Nicholas and I had a little chat and agreed it was best all around."
"754","Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore","Gryffindor","He has enough Elixir to set his affairs in order."
"755","Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore","Gryffindor","But yes, he will die."
"756","Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore","Gryffindor","Ah. You see, only a person who wanted to find the Stone, find it, but not use it, would be able to get it."
"757","Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore","Gryffindor","That is one of my more brilliant ideas."
"758","Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore","Gryffindor","And between you and me thats saying something."
"759","Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore","Gryffindor","Ah, I'm afraid there are ways in which he can return."
"760","Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore","Gryffindor","Harry, do you know why Professor Quirrell couldn't bear to have you touch him?"
"761","Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore","Gryffindor","It was because of your mother."
"762","Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore","Gryffindor","She sacrificed herself for you, and that kind of act leaves a mark."
"763","Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore","Gryffindor","No, no, this kind of mark cannot be seen."
"764","Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore","Gryffindor","It lives in your very skin."
"765","Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore","Gryffindor","Love, Harry, love."
"766","Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore","Gryffindor","Ah. Bertie Bott's Every Flavour Beans."
"767","Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore","Gryffindor","I was most unfortunate in my youth to come across a vomit flavoured one, and since then I have lost my liking for them."
"768","Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore","Gryffindor","But I think I could be safe with a nice toffee..."
"769","Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore","Gryffindor","Mm. Alas. Earwax."
"770","Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore","Gryffindor","Another year gone."
"771","Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore","Gryffindor","And now, as I understand it, the house cup needs awarding, and the points stand thus."
"772","Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore","Gryffindor","In fourth place, Gryffindor with 312 points."
"773","Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore","Gryffindor","Third place, Hufflepuff, with 352 points."
"774","Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore","Gryffindor","In second place, Ravenclaw, with 426 points"
"775","Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore","Gryffindor","And in first place, with 472 points, Slytherin House."
"776","Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore","Gryffindor","Yes, yes, well done Slytherin, well done Slytherin."
"777","Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore","Gryffindor","However, recent events must be taken into account."
"778","Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore","Gryffindor","And I have a few last minute points to award."
"779","Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore","Gryffindor","To Miss Hermione Granger, for the use of cool intellect when others were in great peril, 50 points."
"780","Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore","Gryffindor","Second, to Mr. Ronald Weasley, for the best played game of chess that Hogwarts has seen these many years...50 points."
"781","Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore","Gryffindor","And third, to Mr. Harry Potter, for pure nerve and outstanding courage, I award Gryffindor house 60 points."
"782","Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore","Gryffindor","And finally, it takes a great deal of bravery to stand up to your enemies, but a great deal more to stand up to your friends."
"783","Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore","Gryffindor","I award 10 points to Neville Longbottom."
"784","Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore","Gryffindor","Assuming that my calculations are correct, I believe that a change of direction is in order."
"785","Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore","Gryffindor","Gryffindor wins the House Cup!"
"786","Rubeus Hagrid","Gryffindor",NA
"787","Neville Longbottom","Gryffindor","Trevor! Sorry."

"790","Neville Longbottom","Gryffindor","Down, down!"
"791","Neville Longbottom","Gryffindor","Parvati Patil said that she wouldn't come out of the girl's bathroom."
"792","Neville Longbottom","Gryffindor","She said that she'd been in there all afternoon...crying."
"793","Neville Longbottom","Gryffindor","How? I can barely stand at all!"
"794","Neville Longbottom","Gryffindor","No, that's all I need!"
"795","Neville Longbottom","Gryffindor","You to set my bloody kneecups on fire!"
"796","Neville Longbottom","Gryffindor","Hey! Wait! Where are you going?"
"797","Neville Longbottom","Gryffindor","What about the countercurse?"
"798","Neville Longbottom","Gryffindor","Neither should you."
"799","Neville Longbottom","Gryffindor","You're sneaking out again, arent you?"
"800","Neville Longbottom","Gryffindor","No! I won't let you!"

"873","Minerva McGonagall","Gryffindor","Do you think it wise to trust Hagrid with something as important as this?"
"874","Minerva McGonagall","Gryffindor","I've watched them all day."
"875","Minerva McGonagall","Gryffindor","They're the worst sort of Muggles, imaginable."
"876","Minerva McGonagall","Gryffindor","They really are..."
"877","Minerva McGonagall","Gryffindor","This boy will be famous."
"878","Minerva McGonagall","Gryffindor","There won't be a child in our world who doesn't know his name."
"879","Minerva McGonagall","Gryffindor","Welcome to Hogwarts."
"880","Minerva McGonagall","Gryffindor","Now, in a few moments, you'll pass through these doors and join your classmates."
"881","Minerva McGonagall","Gryffindor","But before you can take your seats, you must be sorted into your houses."
"882","Minerva McGonagall","Gryffindor","They are Gryffindor, Hufflepuff Ravenclaw and Slytherin."
"883","Minerva McGonagall","Gryffindor","Now, while you're here, your house will be like your family."
"884","Minerva McGonagall","Gryffindor","Your triumphs will earn you points."
"885","Minerva McGonagall","Gryffindor","Any rule-breaking, and you will lose points."
"886","Minerva McGonagall","Gryffindor","At the end of the year, the house with the most points is awarded the house cup"
"887","Minerva McGonagall","Gryffindor","The Sorting Ceremony will begin momentarily."
"888","Minerva McGonagall","Gryffindor","We're ready for you now."
"889","Minerva McGonagall","Gryffindor","Follow me."
"890","Minerva McGonagall","Gryffindor","All right, will you wait along here, please?"
"891","Minerva McGonagall","Gryffindor","Now, before we begin Professor Dumbledore would like to say a few words."
"892","Minerva McGonagall","Gryffindor","When I call your name, you will come forth."
"893","Minerva McGonagall","Gryffindor","I shall place the Sorting Hat on your head and you will be sorted into your houses."

"901","Minerva McGonagall","Gryffindor","Perhaps, lt'd be more useful if I were to transfigure Mr. Potter and yourself into a pocket-watch."
"902","Minerva McGonagall","Gryffindor","That way, one of you might be on time."
"903","Minerva McGonagall","Gryffindor","Then perhaps a map?"
"904","Minerva McGonagall","Gryffindor","I trust you don't need one to find your seats."
"905","Minerva McGonagall","Gryffindor","Harry Potter!"
"906","Minerva McGonagall","Gryffindor","Follow me."
"907","Minerva McGonagall","Gryffindor","You wait here."
"908","Minerva McGonagall","Gryffindor","Professor Quirrell, excuse me."
"909","Minerva McGonagall","Gryffindor","Could I borrow Wood for a moment please?"
"910","Minerva McGonagall","Gryffindor","Potter, this is Oliver Wood."
"911","Minerva McGonagall","Gryffindor","Wood, I have found you a Seeker."
"912","Minerva McGonagall","Gryffindor","Oh! Oh, my goodness!"
"913","Minerva McGonagall","Gryffindor","E-Explain yourselves, both of you!"
"914","Minerva McGonagall","Gryffindor","Ms. Granger?"
"915","Minerva McGonagall","Gryffindor","Be that as it may...it was an extremely foolish thing to do."
"916","Minerva McGonagall","Gryffindor","I would have expected more rational behaviour on your part and I am very disappointed in you Ms. Granger."
"917","Minerva McGonagall","Gryffindor","5 points will be taken from Gryffindor for your serious lack of judgment."
"918","Minerva McGonagall","Gryffindor","As for you two gentlemen I just hope you realize how fortunate you are."
"919","Minerva McGonagall","Gryffindor","Not many first year students could take on a full grown mountain troll and live to tell the tale."
"920","Minerva McGonagall","Gryffindor","5 points...will be awarded to each of you."
"921","Minerva McGonagall","Gryffindor","For sheer dumb luck."
"922","Minerva McGonagall","Gryffindor","Good evening."
"923","Minerva McGonagall","Gryffindor","Nothing, I repeat, nothing gives a student the right to walk about the school at night."
"924","Minerva McGonagall","Gryffindor","Therefore, as punishment for your actions, 50 points will be taken."
"925","Minerva McGonagall","Gryffindor","Each. And to ensure it doesn't happen again, all four of you will receive detention."
"926","Minerva McGonagall","Gryffindor","No, you heard me correctly, Mr. Malfoy."
"927","Minerva McGonagall","Gryffindor","You see, as honorable as your intentions were, you too were out of bed after hours."
"928","Minerva McGonagall","Gryffindor","You will join your classmates in detention."
"929","Minerva McGonagall","Gryffindor","I'm afraid Professor Dumbledore is not here."
"930","Minerva McGonagall","Gryffindor","He received an urgent owl from the Ministry of Magic and left immediately for London."
"931","Minerva McGonagall","Gryffindor","How do you know?"
"932","Minerva McGonagall","Gryffindor","I don't know how you three found out about the stone, but I can assure you it is perfectly well-protected."
"933","Minerva McGonagall","Gryffindor","Now would you go back to your dormitories? Quietly."
"934","Molly Weasley","Gryffindor","It's the same every year, packed with Muggles, Of course."

"939","Molly Weasley","Gryffindor","Oh, I'm sorry, George."
"940","Molly Weasley","Gryffindor","How to get onto the platform?"
"941","Molly Weasley","Gryffindor","Not to worry, dear."
"942","Molly Weasley","Gryffindor","It's Ron's first time to Hogwarts as well."
"943","Molly Weasley","Gryffindor","All you've got do is walk straight at the wall between platforms 9 and 10."

"958","Quirinus Quirrell","Ravenclaw","Next to him, who would suspect, """"p-p-poor s-stuttering Professor Quirrell?"""""
"959","Quirinus Quirrell","Ravenclaw","No, dear boy. I tried to kill you!"

"961","Quirinus Quirrell","Ravenclaw","Even with Snape muttering his little counter-curse."
"962","Quirinus Quirrell","Ravenclaw","I knew you were a danger right from the off."

"966","Quirinus Quirrell","Ravenclaw","While everyone else was running to the dungeon, he went to the 3rd floor to head me off."
